    "description": "ecurity Tester qualification is aimed at people who have already achieved an advanced point in their careers in software testing and wish to develop further their expertise in security testing. The modules offered at the Advanced Level cover a wide range of testing topics.Application security testing is an approach to validate security requirements and uncover vulnerabilities in an application (web / mobile / thick client / web services) and its associated components, by performing static and dynamic security testing. Security testing is becoming a crucial validation activity. It cuts across the lines of business (LOB), enterprise testing, and shared services. Thus, chief information security officers (CISOs) and several information security groups are looking to add security testing as a new service line.The Certification is helpful in demonstrating the attacker mentality by discovering key information about a target, performing actions on a test application in a protected environment that a malicious person would perform, and understand how evidence of the attack could be deleted.",
