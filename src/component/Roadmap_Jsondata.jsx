Pen testers use a variety of methods to attempt to penetrate a system, including but not limited to, trying to guess passwords, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using social engineering techniques.It takes a special kind of person to be a penetration tester - someone with the skills to find security vulnerabilities and exploit them. To be successful in this career, you need to be good at hacking, reverse engineering, and cryptography. You must also be able to think like a hacker, reasoning your way through complex problems and identifying potential exploits.An MCSI qualified professional penetration tester can provide comprehensive web application and infrastructure penetration tests. By identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, a pen tester can help organizations identify and fix security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.The MPT Certification from MCSI signifies that you have the competencies that the industry is seeking, making you a valuable asset for Penetration Testing jobs worldwide.",

This is normally done via the many advanced techniques and utilities of a security consultant.The Certified Penetration Tester (CPT)® certification is for security personnel whose job duties involve assessing target networks and systems to find security vulnerabilities. Certification objectives include penetration-testing methodologies, the legal issues surrounding penetration testing and how to properly conduct a penetration test as well as best practice technical and non-technical techniques specific to conduct a penetration test.Penetration testing is the job that most IT ‘techies’ aspire to, and means you get to work with some cutting edge technologies, and technically excellent colleagues.

    "description": "The retired Cracking the Perimeter (CTP) course and its certification, OffSec Certified Expert (OSCE), was part of the OffSec’s curriculum for a long time. From its beginning, CTP was envisioned as a natural continuation of the learning path for which Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PEN-200) served as the foundation. This path ultimately culminated in our most advanced course, Advanced Windows Exploitation (AWE).When CTP was first conceived it attempted to cover three different areas of pentesting expertise: attacking web applications, advanced userland exploit development (manual encoding, egg hunters, etc.) and antivirus evasion, and attacks against network and edge devices. This led to a course that covered the primary areas where advanced penetration testers spent most of their time. With the level of defense and traditional network complexity at the time, we could cover all these topics adequately in a single course.However, with the technology and defense mechanisms greatly improving since we released CTP, in 2020, we decided it was time for an overhaul and for a number of years, it was our vision to create individual courses that focus more intensely on the attack areas and techniques taught in the CTP course. The first step in that plan was to create and release an online course that focuses on web application attacks: Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (WEB-300), which was released in 2019.Following the WEB-300 release, we launched 2 courses in late 2020 and early 2021:Advanced Evasion Techniques and Breaching Defenses (PEN-300); a course that focuses on more advanced and modern pentesting techniques that cover AV avoidance, lateral movements, and so on.Windows User Mode Exploitation Development (EXP-301); a course that focuses exclusively on Windows userland exploit development.With the release of these courses, the OSCE³ was created as we believe a special recognition for completing 3 of our advanced courses that demonstrates exceptional mastery of the offensive security domain was warranted.",

The course dives deep into topics ranging from security mitigation bypass techniques to complex heap manipulations and 64-bit kernel exploitation.AWE is a particularly demanding penetration testing course. It requires a significant amount of learner-instructor interaction. Therefore, we limit AWE courses to an in-person, hands-on environment.This is the hardest course we offer and it requires a significant time investment.

In software engineering, reverse engineering is the process of discovering the underlying algorithms and structures of a program, usually by analyzing its executable code. In cyber security, this is done to analyze malware and find vulnerabilities in software in order to protect networks from attacks (or sell zero-days).There are a number of skills required in software reverse engineering. The first is a deep understanding of how software works – what each instruction does, what data structures are used, and how the program flows. The second is a strong technical skillset, including the ability to disassemble code, debug it, and understand assembly language. Finally, reverse engineers must have a good understanding of malicious code and common attack vectors.A professional Reverse Engineer with MCSI qualifications is experienced in conducting static, dynamic, and behavioral analysis against sophisticated and modern malware.MCSI's MRE Certification is globally respected and has helped many students land jobs as Malware Analysts. The certification proves that you have the competencies the industry is seeking, which will give you the confidence to apply for jobs worldwide.",

If you have completed the Malware On Steroids course, then you can merge the capabilities you build during this course with the Command & Control built during the MOS course. This helps you to build your own CnC modules, all of which can be run in memory for detection evasion. There are a lot of courses which focus on exploitation, reversing and other offensive stuff, but none of them focus on writing your own tools and bringing your own toolkit during an engagement.This course is highly technical in nature, involving a lot of coding and all the tools will be written in either C or C++, sometimes PowerShell (maybe 5%) to make sure the user has capability to load every tool in memory and evade memory artefacts or detections. During the course, you will build your own reflective tools and shellcode for Host Enumeration, Lateral Movement, Domain Enumeration and Domain Privilege Escalation. You will learn to build different types of remote access tools running over different protocols including RPC, SMB, and HTTP and use exploit Windows Security Tokens for lateral movement within a Domain Environment.The below figure highlights a brief overview on the focus area of the training session.",

These skills are in high demand by companies and governments who are willing to pay top dollar for information on security vulnerabilities.Many students who take our course develop skills that allows them to generate a new stream of income by selling zero-days of Vulnerability Disclosure Programs. A zero-day is a security vulnerability that has not been publicly disclosed. Selling a zero-day can be very profitable, as the person who discovers the vulnerability can be the only one who knows how to exploit it.An MCSI qualified professional Vulnerability Researcher and Exploitation Specialist is well-equipped to identify software vulnerabilities using techniques such as fuzzing harnesses, code analysis tools, and manual review.
